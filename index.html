        <p>Hey my name is Maura. I am 24 years old and was born and raised in Philadelphia.
        I have two sisters, both older, and up until recently I lived with my mom and dad.
        I began coding in 2017 as a way to make myself more marketable and decided I wanted
        to make it into a career.
        </p>
        <p>Before learning how to code, I went to school at Capital University.
        A small school in Columbus, Ohio. I studied communications and was a member
        of the Univesity's Women's soccer team. I really enjoyed my experience, but wish I head
        chose a different major. 
        </p>
